# ðŸ§  nb-dt-toolkit

This is a Python-based repository that includes handmade implementations of Naive Bayes and Decision Trees - basic machine learning classifiers. This repository includes modular scripts designed for building, evaluating, and utilizing these models.

---

Key highlights:

* ðŸ“Š Naive Bayes Classifier: A probabilistic model for classification tasks.
* ðŸŒ³ Decision Tree Algorithm: A tree-based approach for classification tasks.
* ðŸ§ª Evaluation Tools: Includes a scorer to calculate class probabilities and evaluate model performance for the Decision Trees.
* ðŸ›  Utilities: Helper functions to preprocess data.
